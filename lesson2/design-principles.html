                    <p>Discord is perhaps the most used form of communication within the world of gaming and online celebreties. The reason I picked this for Rule of third is because all of the pictures in the mobile link are not cetered but are placed on
                        a 1/3 position just like this picture. The rest of the images in it's homepage are aligned towards the left. What is most important when having a product is to know it's targeted demographic, which in this case are mostly gamers.
                        Unlike the homepage of Slack which is basically information block after information block, Discord does most of explanation with funky visuals to attract the attention of it's consumer. This is also where the Rule of Third plays
                        it's part, as it gives off a visually more apealling and 'stylish' appearance (which let's face it, is what most gamers look forward to considering the game rooms some of them make, sheesh!).

                    <h3>Occam’s Razor</h3>
                </div>
                <p>Instagram</p>
                <a href="">https://www.instagram.com/</a>

                        Like most well known social media websites, they tend to have little to no information on their homepage because of the mentality of "everyone already knows" which is why they are able to apply Occam's Razor easily without impeding any of the functions
                        of the website. Just like it's counterpart by Meta, Facebook also has the simple short page of blank spaces and sign in options. The reason why I chose this as an Occam’s Razor example over Wattpad is becasue of how short the page
                        is. The main attraction of the main page is simply "are you going to come in, or are you going to come in". The way that Meta does this is simply having the most important function being the one on display (which I could have used
                        visual heirarchy for this as well) but if we look at what the page centers our eyes on, it's a sign in option and a big button to get the app. If this doesn't scream "we want app downloads more than you signing in on your PC" then
                        I don't know what does.

                    <p>Wattpad like most reading platforms would tend to have a lot of white space. The reason that the majority of reading platforms do this is to create a sense of calm and and organization towards the user. Despite the library being clump
                        of book covers, that is what a library would look like. However the white space in Wattpad's design is to give off that feeling of an actual real library when you first enter, that feeling of it being a quiet and calm place where
                        you can read to your hearts content on both the mobile and PC version of the site. It is also there to guide the users eye towards what is most important, letting your family on Facebook know what kind of estranged fanfiction you
                        are reading.
