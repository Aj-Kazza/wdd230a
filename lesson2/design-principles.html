                    <p>Discord is perhaps the most used form of communication within the world of gaming and online celebreties. The reason I picked this for Rule of third is because all of the pictures in the mobile link are not cetered but are placed on
                        a 1/3 position just like this picture. The rest of the images in it's homepage are aligned towards the left. What is most important when having a product is to know it's targeted demographic, which in this case are mostly gamers.
                        Unlike the homepage of Slack which is basically information block after information block, Discord does most of explanation with funky visuals to attract the attention of it's consumer. This is also where the Rule of Third plays
                        it's part, as it gives off a visually more apealling and 'stylish' appearance (which let's face it, is what most gamers look forward to considering the game rooms some of them make, sheesh!).

                        With the advent of online shopping since that moment someone decided at the begining of the internet "hey, I wonder where I can sell this thing I have" to wonders such as Amazon, ebay, and Taobao, online marketplaces are now something that pretty much
                        everyone uses. Since the dawn of shopping, many people have also come up with various ways to make their products fly off the shelf as if some well dressed British person waved a stick and said "Wingardium Leviosa", countless methods
                        and tactics have been cooked up with varying success. The greatest tactic to ever come to pass is "HAVING A BIG DISPLAY FOR A SALE" which in turns becomes the principle of visual hierarchy when it comes to online marketplace, and
                        nobody does it more that the folks on digital marketplaces. There are so many to display, but for my example, GOG or Good Old Games, it tends to have the best deals (or promotions) being displayed on a larger carousel while the
                        rest of the deals or reccomendation are usually within smaller blocks, and after spending AUD $40+ there for a sale just this morning, I think it's working.

                    <p>Wattpad like most reading platforms would tend to have a lot of white space. The reason that the majority of reading platforms do this is to create a sense of calm and and organization towards the user. Despite the library being clump
                        of book covers, that is what a library would look like. However the white space in Wattpad's design is to give off that feeling of an actual real library when you first enter, that feeling of it being a quiet and calm place where
                        you can read to your hearts content on both the mobile and PC version of the site. It is also there to guide the users eye towards what is most important, letting your family on Facebook know what kind of estranged fanfiction you
                        are reading.
