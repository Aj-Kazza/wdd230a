        <h2>Audience</h2>
        <p>The target audience is the local bussiness owners on the island of Tarawa, be they established bussinesses, startups, or community projects. We strive to help and support the bussiness owners to be able to reach the full potential of their craft
            and services.</p>
        <h2>Persona 1</h2>
        <p>Tekai is an aspiring bussinessman who has just recently opened up a shop in his village to support his family and provide a place to obtain neccessities for his community. He loves to talk with his neighbours and everybody enjoys his funny jokes
            when they come to shop. Being in a village that is quite isolated from the rest of the island, he tends to go about his village to see what items and goods are required for the village.</p>
