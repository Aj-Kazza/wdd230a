                </picture>
                <p>Welcom to Tarawa, the capital island of Kiribati and the central trade hub for the Gilbert region along with the rest of the country. With so many commercial movement within the island, it has become a great place to develop, especially
                    with its population of 28,802, which is greater than the majority of the islands. The diverse cultures and backgrounds of various islands intermingling along with the different environment of it's three different councils and the capital,
                    all under the trade banner of the Island Chamber.</p>
                <p>From the busting capital and busy downtown to the urban stretch and the serene northern islets, the various options of a traditional small scale shops and stalls to a big bussiness, the chamber provides all sorts of help and resources
                    to help the various bussiness enlisted.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="left">
                <h1>South Tarawa</h1>
                <picture class="myphoto">
                    <img class="lazyimg" src="images/ph.webp" data-src="images/discover/shop.webp" loading="lazy" alt="roadside stalls at Bikenibeu village">
                    <h2 class="imgdesc">Village Roadside Stalls</h2>
                </picture>
                <p>With the southern stretch taking up a bulk of the island coming in varying landspan, this caused people to be creating with where they placed their bussiness. Small shops and the occasional stall tend to be spread out covering a few block
                    to help out with neccessities within the various neighbourhood. Meanwhile, within the less housing centered areas lies the various bussiness districts, rows of some of the more bigger bussiness and wholesalers.</p>
                <p> With this having the most opportunities to develop a bussiness within it's premises, you are bound to see different types of bussinesses. A mojority of the islands fish and produce markets are concentrated within the southern isle along
                    with the majority of the younger families with the abundance of schools.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="right">
                <h1>North Tarawa</h1>
                <picture class="myphoto">
                    <img class="lazyimg" src="images/ph.webp" data-src="images/discover/bridge.webp" loading="lazy" alt="small bridge that leads separates North and South Tarawa">
                    <h2 class="imgdesc">Bridge to North Tarawa</h2>
                </picture>
                <p>Unlike it's southern counterpart, the northern part of Tarawa consists more of peaceful islets and greenery. North Tarawa consists of various islets with the majority of smaller ones concentrating more on tourism and resorts. With the
                    small amount of resources and traffic here, it tends to depends on the southern island for most of it's products however with it being the greener part, it allows it to have a coconut and other produces to be equal to that of outer
                    islands. The local demographic here consists of young children and the elderly with most people pursuing their careers in the southern island, leaving the tropical paradise to those who need it.</p>
                <p>Another key highlight is the bridge that connects the first islet of the northern council to the southern island being a popular picnic and hangout spot. Not many people know as well that instead of heading for a long while to go back
                    to the Nawerewere bussiness strip, there is a hidden village just perpendicular to the bridge's beach, yes a real life hidden leaf village. Needs more advertisement and development, and you could be the one to do so!</p>

            <div class="left">
                <h1>Capital & Downtown</h1>
                <picture class="myphoto">
                    <img class="lazyimg" src="images/ph.webp" data-src="images/discover/market.webp" loading="lazy" alt="marketplace at Bairiki shopping district">
                    <h2 class="imgdesc">Capital Marketplace</h2>
                </picture>
                <p>A contrasting view with the previous entry, the capital and downtown is the center of practically all trade, however with the limited spaces, they had to get creative. Containing the most bussiness condensed within a short distance of
                    each other along with a few small idustrial zones, it also stands out with it having the largest marketplace within the island.</p>
                <p>With most large bussiness's and even the Chamber's main office being located here, it not only a place where commerce is the most bustling but also where paperworks fly as much as the pigeons over at the capital square outside our window.
                    A neat place for advertising as well, which we will also gladly help with, just as long as the old ladies in the marketplace don't chase us away for advertising.</p>
                <p>The majority of the population here are people working at the ministries, government organization and factories, and those people who seek the entertainment provided downtown, it has the most varying demographic out of the entire island.</p>

                <h1>A Trip Through History</h1>

                    <h2 class="imgdesc">Back Then We Used Bartering</h2>
                </picture>
                <p>Being an island nation, trade and commerce tend to work differently as the concept of currency was not available till recently, hence we had to get creative.</p>
                <p>Bartering, the act of exchanging one's excess items to one who lacks in order to gain what we lack from those who excess. A marvelous circle of trade caused a lot of people to focus on one particular set of skill and perfecting them in
                    order to exchange for the things they lack as a means to make ends meet, and a very efficient one.</p>
                <p>While being the island that had the least amount of encountours with sailors and traders in the beggining, Tarawa has managed to differenciate itself from the rest of the islands as a place of trade, learning and growth and is now regarded
                    as the country's crown jewel.(we aren't counting those uninhabited tourist destinations in the eastern provinces, because that would just be unfair at this point)</p>
